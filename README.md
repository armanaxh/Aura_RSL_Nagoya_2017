==================================

The Robocup Rescue Simulation Platform is a comprehensive simulation environment for research in disaster response management. During rescue operations after a disaster, cooperation is a must. In general the problem is not solvable by a single agent, and a heterogeneous team that dynamically combines individual capabilities in order to solve the task is needed. This requirement is due to the structural diversity of disaster areas, variety of evidence the sensors can perceive and to the necessity of quickly and reliably examining large regions. Yet, the performance of a joint rescue team depends on assembling the right mixture of capabilities and has to be designed as a whole. The goal of this league is to take this technological and scientific challenge and extend current rescue robot platforms with planning, learning, and information exchange capabilities needed to coordinate their efforts and to accomplish the rescue mission as a team. Robocup Rescue Simulation is an education and research project intended to promote the development of robotic agents for search and rescue.
